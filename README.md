# SpaceX Launch Success Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the success or failure of SpaceX launches using historical launch data. The dataset contains features like launch details, rocket information, launch site, and success/failure outcomes. Using this data, I built a various machine learning model to predict the success of future launches. This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** course.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- SQL
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from SpaceX's historical launch data. It includes:
- Launch details
- Rocket and payload information
- Success/failure outcomes etc.

## Model
For this project, I used various models to predict launch success. Key steps include:
1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, transforming, and encoding features)
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training
4. HyperParameter tuning
5. Model evaluation

## PowerPoint Presentation
A detailed explanation of the project, including the methodology, data analysis, and results, is available in the PowerPoint presentation file placed in the repository.
